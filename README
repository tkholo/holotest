building:
sudo docker build -t h1 .


running:
sudo docker run --name h1 -d -p 8080:80 -i -t h1

there is a conservative 20sec delay between the container starting and nginx being available


other options:
there is a python script:
generate_test_data.py filename count
with no deps outside random() and /dev/urandom that can generate random data in bulk.  this is run on setup to create a 1000 row file inside the container.

this can be ingested in to the database via the ui, or calling nginx/test_file_upload.sh from within the container, or a similar script/command against port 8080 from outside the container or the cmd_wrapper.py

there is a sample file test_data_err_20.txt that contains many errors that can be ingested to test those routes

python cmd_wrapper.py can be used to hit the endpoint from python.  it takes a url, a command, and when applicable (currently just the file name for submit_file), a parameter

these all run very basic curl commands to run/test bnasic commands
test_file_upload.sh
test_get_data.sh
test_get_errors.sh
